heroSlider v1.00

What is heroSlider?
heroSlider is an easy to use, fully customizable responsive slider which generally is used as a "Hero Unit" on a website. However heroSlider's customizability and scalability makes it a quick and easy solution for anything a designer may have in mind.

Why is it so awesome?
heroSlider uses divs added consecutively on a page as the "slides", which means it supports any type of content or styling not just images. All you need to do is wrap the slide divs and add a bit of jquery to your page to get it running. heroSlider is also responsive right out of the box to support the new expectations of content on webpages. heroSlider also supports a wide range of options which can be passed in to the plugin to modify the plugin's behaviour.

Current Features:
    1. Supports any number of slides
    2. Auto Scrolling options
    3. Customizable speeds and delays
    4. Sliding transition effects
    5. Automatically added and customizable navigation buttons
    6. Responsive design implementation

Planned Features:
    1. Auto-scroll timeout (And looping options)
    2. Better UX options, (Pause on hover, "jump-to" bar)
    3. More selection for transitions
    4. Automatically added and customizable "jump-to" bar
    5. Better button options (including enable/disable)
    6. Parallax background scrolling for extra sexy scrollers
    7. Better compatibility with older and mobile browsers

Installation Instructions:
    A complete writeup with examples is coming soon. For now, put the code somewhere in your site and include it as necessary.
    An example implementation has been included in the form of the styles.css, index.js and index.html page which you can use as a guide to implementing it on your own page.
    The plugin files are in the heroSlider subdirectory, everything else is example implementation code.
    Currently button css is fully customizable but is included in the heroSlider.css file.
